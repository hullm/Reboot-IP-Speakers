# Reboot-IP-Speakers
RebootSpeakersHS.py and RebootSpeakersES.py will reboot all the IP speakers in each building of our school.  We can grep the file for a room and it will display the IP of the switch and the port number.  Then we can use RebootPort.py with the IP of the switch and the port as parameters and to reboot a single speaker.  If you need to change the VLAN of a port you can use ChangeVLAN.py.
